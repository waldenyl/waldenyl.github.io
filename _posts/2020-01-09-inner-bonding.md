When a serious and fulfilling relationship breaks after a winter, a person might be motivated to think more about what was happening in the past few winter.
This is after a person accepted the fact that the pain is unavoidable, and that nobody other than oneself could make the situation better.
If for an extended period in a child's early life, nobody ever formed a meaningful bond with him/her, the child will take it personally.
They will not think that the parents or caretakers are busy at their things (in most of the cases) or are merely dismissive, instead, they will think it is *their* fault.
When the child grows up, the adult self is composed of a fragmented personality--the overt, adult self, and the covert, inner child.
A substantial number of attachment issues, which in their surface look like problems with other people, can be rooted in the relationship between the person and the inner child.
