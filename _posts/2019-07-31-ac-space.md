# AC Space
According to anecdotal evidence from my lab mates, the ACVS is one of the more popular experiments among our mTurkers.
Indeed, look how colorful the display is.

This project is based on the findings of the Adaptive Choice Visual Search (ACVS) task developed by my adviser Dr. Andy
Leber 

As my first research project advised by Andy Leber, this project also has a special meaning to me. So, I decide to keep
a page for the updates of the project.

# Introduction
Imagine you are in a stadium watching an exciting women’s soccer championship final
with your friends. You are so concentrated on your favorite player and fail to notice a rogue fan
rushing into the field before causing an uproar. The reason why you are unaware is that you are
not paying attention to what happens outside that small area in which you are tracking the player.
Since we are not able to fully process everything in our visual field, a selection process must
happen, leaving only a fraction of the visual activities for our conscious mind. Such selection
processes happen in every second, one of which is enabled by _visual search_.

What makes someone faster than others in finding some object? Of course, some people
are born with more ability, but the strategy used in visual search also accounts for a large
proportion of how efficient the search is. Let’s stick with the soccer player for another moment;
what does she do when she wants to pass the ball forward to the striker? While the striker is
surrounded by many defenders, she knows that she can either look for red shirts or blue shorts
because that’s what her team wears. But imagine when the opposing team wears shorts that
closely resemble blue—maybe indigo. In this case, trying to search for blue shorts gives the
player less of an advantage, since she needs to search through more potential targets to locate the
striker. In this example, the strategy that the player uses is not a good one that will yield efficient
search. While it seems intuitive that people always try to use a good strategy to benefit their
performance, recent research found that people’s visual search strategy is far less than optimal
(Irons & Leber, 2016). Visual search is not limited to sports—many responsibilities, including
airport baggage screening and radiological image reading, involve visual search. Why do people
consistently use sub-optimal strategy? Can we improve people’s strategy by training? To answer
these questions, there is a need to understand visual search strategy in a more comprehensive
way.

The importance of strategy in visual search, however, is contrasted with a rather limited
body of research on visual search strategy (e.g., Kristjánsson, Jóhannesson, & Thornton, 2014;
Irons & Leber, 2016, 2018; Nowakowska et al., 2017). One of the recent studies that have made
a successful attempt on characterizing individual differences in visual search strategy introduces
a new visual search paradigm—the adaptive choice visual search task (ACVS; Irons & Leber,
2016, 2019). Different from traditional visual search tasks where participants are typically asked
to search for only one target in each trial, the ACVS paradigm involves a display where two
targets are present. However, only one target is considered the “optimal” one (see figure 1).
Researchers are able to assess an individual’s strategy use with two key measurements in the
task: the proportion of optimal choices, which is the percentage of trials in which participants
choose the optimal target, and the switch rate, the percentage of trials in which participants
switch between two target types. Efficient searchers who complete the search task faster than
others typically select more optimal targets and avoid unnecessary switching during the
experiment, showing a high proportion of optimal choices and lower switch rates. These two
crucial parameters, then, grant the ACVS the ability to improve the current research of goaldirected
attentional control by adding strategy measurements to the methodology toolbox beyond
traditionally used reaction times and accuracy. Studies with the adaptive choice visual search
task have shown a large range of individual differences in the proportion of optimal choices and
switch rates (Irons & Leber, 2016), both of which have also been proved to have good test-retest
reliability, suggesting a trait-like behavior pattern (Irons & Leber, 2018).
