Despite a few radically deviated theories, _representation_ is still a critical concept in cognitive science research. The nature of representation, however, is a big problem for cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind. I still remember Dr. Alex Petrov said in his class that the topic of representation is something we all refer to, but few people really know when they are referring to it. 

Inspired by Jake Quilty-Dunn’s (2018) recent paper “Perceptual Pluralism”, I set out to explore the theme of representational pluralism in both perception and cognition. This is by no means a simple essay to write, especially when I feel I still have so little reading in the related topics. However, I do want to try to put something under this title, and hope to refine it bit by bit. Different from ACVS, this project might need me several years to finish, but I nevertheless feel worth it. Right now, a good plan is to brainstorm some ideas I already have in mind, and then through continuous reading and thinking, I (). I feel especially happy when I find out I am surrounded by people who also like to think about these things. Nothing makes me feel more lucky than working in a lab with an advisor and these lovely colleagues who share a genuine interest in human cognition, so that we can share the passion in philosophical topics while doing our psychological experiments.

### Perceptual Representation

Quilty-Dunn (2018) in his paper “Perceptual Pluralism” proposes that perceptual object representations have an iconic format and a discursive format, both of which are well supported by empirical research. Compared to a large body of literature discussing the content of perceptual representation, the “vehicle” of the representation, or format, is less discussed. The study of concepts also indicates conceptual representation format is also an area of interesting focus

The cognitive revolution in the last century shifted people’s attention to the internal states of our mind. With the rapid movement of computer science, people were convinced that our brain is an information processing unit, which takes symbolic representations from perception as an input, and manipulates them to generate an output. This view implies that our brain represents everything in the world with arbitrary symbols, similar to what a computer does, in which different instances of objects are stored in randomized memory locations. The first wave of
